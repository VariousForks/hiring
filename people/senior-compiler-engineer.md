## Senior Compiler Engineer
[Luna](https://luna-lang.org) is looking for a senior compiler engineer to help
build the next generation compiler and runtime for Luna, a project said by
Singularity University to have the potential to change the lives of one-billion
people. If you have strong technical skills and a passion for all things
compiler, then this role could be the one for you.

As a compiler engineer you'll work as part of the compiler team to design and
implement the new Luna compiler and runtime, work that is at the very core of
the next phase of Luna's development. You'll have the opportunity to collaborate
with a world-class team of engineers, community managers, and business
developers (with experience at Bloomberg, GitHub, and PayPal, to name a few),
and make your indelible mark on the future of Luna.

#### What You'll Do
As a senior compiler developer, you'll be working on the design and development
of the new Luna compiler and runtime, to help support the Language's evolution.
This will involve:

- Working to design and implement the new Luna interpreter, including the 
  typechecker, optimiser, and foreign-language interoperability.
- Theoretical and practical treatments of the theory behind Luna's type-system,
  and the implementation of the type inference and type checking engines for the
  same.
- Practical work improving both the performance and capabilities of the new
  interpreter.
- Practical work implementing front-end optimisations for Luna that improve the
  code that is executed by the interpreter.

#### The Skills We're Looking For
We have a few particular skills that we're looking for in this role:

- Practical and rich experience writing code in both Scala and Java, including
  experience with type-level programming techniques in the former (3+ years).
- A deep understanding of the JVM, its execution model, and garbage collection
  behaviours, born of practical experience.
- Experience using the JVM's profiling and debugging tools to solve problems on
  large-scale projects.
- Practical experience building large and complex software systems.
- Experience in building compilers and/or the design of type systems.

It would be a big bonus if you had:

- Experience with GraalVM and the Truffle framework for programming language
  development.
- Experience with dependent type systems, row types, type-checking algorithms,
  and type-inference.

## About Luna
Luna is an award-winning general-purpose programming language and data-science
platform, selected by NASA and Singularity University as a technology with the
potential to impact the lives of one-billion people worldwide. It spans the
entire stack, from high-level visualisation and communication, to the
nitty-gritty of running backend services in a single language. With inbuilt
capabilities for visualisation and a dual-syntax architecture, the possibilities
are limitless.

At Luna, we have a world-class team, with developers, community managers, and
business developers from all walks of life and backgrounds, and work in close
collaboration with industry advisers such as Robert Gentleman, the creator of
the R programming language and computational biologist at 23andMe, and Edward
Kmett, a skilled language designer and machine intelligence researcher at MIRI.

We welcome anybody to our team, as long as you have the desire and drive to see
Luna succeed.

## Who You'll Work With
You'll be joining a distributed, multi-disciplinary team that includes people
with skills spanning from compiler development to data-science. Though you'll
have your area to work on, our internal culture is one of collaboration and
communication, and input is always welcomed.

We firmly believe that only by working _together_, rather than putting our team
members in their own boxes, can we create the best version of Luna that can be.

## The Details
As part of the Luna team you'd be able to work from anywhere, whether that be at
home, or on the go! We have team members distributed across the world, from San
Francisco, to London, to Kraków. We welcome remote work and flexible schedules,
or you can work from the Kraków office (or our planned SF office) if you'd like.
We can provide competitive compensation and holiday, as well as the possibility
of equity as time goes on.

## How To Apply?
Send us an email at `jobs@luna-lang.org`, and tell us a little bit about
yourself and why you think you'd be a good fit for the role! You can also tell
us about:

- Some of your past work or projects.
- Why you'd like to work on Luna, and where you imagine Luna being in 5 years.
- The most important features of a team that you'd like to work in.
- Whether you take pride in your ability to communicate clearly and efficiently
  with your team.
