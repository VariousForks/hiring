## GUI Developer
[Luna](https://luna-lang.org) is looking for a GUI developer to take charge of
the design, development, and evolution of a new WebGL-based GUI for Luna, a 
project said by Singularity University to have the potential to change the lives 
of one-billion people. If you bring strong technical skills and a passion for 
user experience, this could be the role for you.

As a GUI developer you'll be a key part of bringing the vision for Luna 2.0 into
reality, with your work being integral to the realisation of the next iteration
of Luna. You'll be able to collaborate with world-class team of skilled
engineers, community managers, and business developers (from Bloomberg, PayPal,
and GitHub to name a few), and make your indelible mark on the future of Luna.  

**What You'll Do**  
As a GUI developer you'll be in charge of the creation of the new front-end for
the Luna IDE: Luna Studio. This will involve:

- Working closely with stakeholders and customers to design intuitive solutions
  that unobtrusively enable a fluid workflow.
- Implement these solutions in a high-performance manner on top of web
  technologies to create a truly cross-platform GUI.
- Building a next-generation UI framework based on WebGL.
- Work with the details of WebGL and JavaScript to ensure a seamless and
  performant experience for users.
- Contribute to the creation of a vibrant open-source project and its ecosystem.  
  
**The Skills We're Looking For**  
We have a few particular skills that we're looking for in this role:

- A strong focus on both user experience and aesthetics.
- Experience with OpenGL or WebGL, and the related GLSL. We'd also hope for
  knowledge of GPU pipelines and architectures, and practical experience in
  optimising GLSL.
- Knowledge and experience with JavaScript (or a related language such as
  CoffeeScript or TypeScript), and practical usage of it for large-scale
  projects.

It would be a big bonus if you had:

- Knowledge of PureScript, Elm, Haskell, or some other strongly-typed functional
  programming language.
- Experience with visual programming systems such as Houdini, Max/MSP, Lab VIEW,
  or Touch Designer.


## About Luna
Luna is an award-winning general-purpose programming language and data-science
platform, selected by NASA and Singularity University as a technology with the
potential to impact the lives of one-billion people worldwide. It spans the
entire stack, from high-level visualisation and communication, to the
nitty-gritty of running backend services in a single language. With inbuilt
capabilities for visualisation and a dual-syntax architecture, the possibilities
are limitless.

At Luna, we have a world-class team, with developers, community managers, and
business developers from all walks of life and backgrounds, and work in close
collaboration with industry advisers such as Robert Gentleman, the creator of
the R programming language and computational biologist at 23andMe, and Edward
Kmett, a skilled language designer and machine intelligence researcher at MIRI.

We welcome anybody to our team, as long as you have the desire and drive to see
Luna succeed.


## Who You'll Work With
You'll be joining a distributed, multi-disciplinary team that includes people
with skills spanning from compiler development to data-science. Though you'll
have your area to work on, our internal culture is one of collaboration and
communication, and input is always welcomed.

We firmly believe that only by working _together_, rather than putting our team
members in their own boxes, can we create the best version of Luna that can be.

## The Details
As part of the Luna team you'd be able to work from anywhere, whether that be at
home, or on the go! We have team members distributed across the world, from San
Francisco, to London, to Kraków. We welcome remote work and flexible schedules,
or you can work from the Kraków office (or our planned SF office) if you'd like.
We can provide competitive compensation and holiday, as well as the possibility
of equity as time goes on.

## How To Apply?
Send us an email at `jobs@luna-lang.org`, and tell us a little bit about
yourself and why you think you'd be a good fit for the role! You can also tell
us about:

- Some of your past work or projects.
- Why you'd like to work on Luna, and where you imagine Luna being in 5 years.
- The most important features of a team that you'd like to work in.
- Whether you take pride in your ability to communicate clearly and efficiently
  with your team.
